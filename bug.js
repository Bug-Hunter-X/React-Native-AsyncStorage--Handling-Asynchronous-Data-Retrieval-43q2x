This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and you try to access the stored data before it has been fully retrieved. This usually happens when you use `AsyncStorage.getItem` inside a function that doesn't handle the asynchronous nature of the operation correctly.  For example:

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
const [data, setData] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  const getData = async () => {
    const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('@my_key');
    setData(value);
  };
  getData();
}, []);

return (
  <Text>{data}</Text> // data might be null here, causing the error
);
```

The `setData(value)` will be called after `await AsyncStorage.getItem` is finished, but React might try to render the component before then, resulting in an error (e.g., `undefined is not an object` if you try to access a property of `data`).
